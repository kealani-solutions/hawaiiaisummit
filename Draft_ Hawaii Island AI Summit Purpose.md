### Hawaii Island AI Summit

##### "Leadership and Builders"

##### 1\. Why This Matters

AI is transforming how businesses operate everywhere. But too often, our island watches from the sidelines — waiting for knowledge and tools that flow easily to the mainland but rarely reach us.

The Hawaiʻi Island AI Summit changes that.

We're bringing practical, hands-on AI knowledge directly to our local business owners, entrepreneurs, and professionals. Not hype. Not theory. Real tools our community can put to work.

Guided by *"Ma ka hana ka ʻike"* — learn by doing — this summit is built by practitioners for practitioners.

We are guided by the following principles:

* **Deliver Practical Value:**  To provide informative, high-energy conversations and hands-on workshops that equip attendees with actionable insights.  
* **Foster Meaningful Connections:**  To ensure every participant leaves with valuable learnings, hands-on experiences, potential partner leads, and lasting professional connections.  
* **Embrace Hands-On Learning:**  To honor the practitioner-focused philosophy of  *"Ma ka hana ka ʻike"*  (learn by doing), ensuring our content is delivered by experts who are actively engaged in the work.This blueprint details our vision for a landmark event and invites you to be a part of it.
